* Let me override [] array declarations
* Let me override "" string declarations
* Let me override %w[ .. ] and all it's variations (like I can with backticks)
* Let me override %[ ]
* Variable names should support all the same characters as method names (eg. !, ?, =, etc)

* Let me declare more prefix methods on a class (like ~ but more arbitrary characters)
* Symbols should support all the same characters as strings, or at least :=
* Let me dynamically declare local variables. I should be able to use local_variable_set in the main namespace (I had to do a hack with define attributes)
* Expand the potential uses of (), maybe even let me override those (similar to [])
* I want to be able to dynamically get the source code of a ruby method.
